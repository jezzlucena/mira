# Mission & Vision: Mira

> **The Mirror, Not the Judge.**

## 1. Executive Summary
**Mira** is a cross-platform (Web, Desktop, Mobile) habit tracking application built on the philosophy of harm reduction and radical self-observation. Unlike traditional habit trackers that focus on "streaks" and gamified perfectionism, Mira focuses on data collection, emotional context, and pattern recognition. We provide the tools for users to define their own behaviors—whether they wish to nurture, reduce, or simply understand them—without passing moral judgment.

---

## 2. Mission Statement
**To empower individuals with an accessible, judgment-free ecosystem for self-observation.**

We exist to help users bridge the gap between their behaviors and their emotions. By providing a neutral space to track any action—from flossing to gambling, from reading to smoking—we allow users to visualize the relationship between what they do and how they feel, fostering autonomy through data.

---

## 3. Vision Statement
**A world where personal growth is driven by self-awareness rather than shame.**

We envision a future where technology supports the complexity of human behavior. We strive to be the standard for "humane analytics," where the user is the sole arbiter of what constitutes a "good" or "bad" habit, and where progress is measured by understanding, not just abstinence or repetition.

## 4. Core Values

### 🛡️ Harm Reduction Over Perfection
We reject the "break the chain" mentality that induces shame. A missed day is not a failure; it is a data point. We support users in managing habits they aren't ready to quit completely, focusing on safety, reduction, and awareness.

### ⚖️ User-Defined Morality
The app is agnostic. It does not label smoking as "Bad" or yoga as "Good" by default. The user assigns value to their actions. If a user wants to track "Lying" to understand *why* they do it, the app supports them with the same neutrality as someone tracking "Drinking Water."

### 🌐 Universal Accessibility
Habits happen everywhere. Our tool must be available everywhere.
* **Multi-Platform:** Seamless sync capabilities across Web, Desktop, and Mobile.
* **Inclusivity:** High contrast support, screen reader compatibility, and cognitive-load-friendly design for neurodivergent users (ADHD/ASD friendly).

### 📊 Context is King
An action without emotional context is incomplete data.
* **The 1-6 Scale:** Every entry is accompanied by a mandatory, low-friction sentiment log (1 = Very Negative, 6 = Very Positive).
* **The Insight:** We don't just tell you *that* you smoked; we show you that you smoke when you feel a `2`, and that you feel a `5` immediately after, but a `1` two hours later.

## 5. Product Pillars

### The "All-Habits" Approach
Most apps bifurcate habits into "Do" and "Don't." We view habits as a spectrum. Users can track:
* **Biological needs:** Sleep, water, medication.
* **Productivity:** Reading news, coding, cooking.
* **Vices/Coping Mechanisms:** Smoking, nail-biting, gambling, spending.

### The Sentiment Engine
The core differentiator of Mira is the correlation engine.
* **Input:** User logs "Bite Nails" + Mood `2/6` (Anxious).
* **Output:** Analytics show a heat map correlating low mood scores with specific habit triggers.
* **Goal:** Move from reactive behavior to conscious choice.

### Privacy First
Because we allow the tracking of sensitive subjects (substance use, mental health struggles), user privacy is paramount.
* End-to-End Encryption options.
* Local-first data storage preference.
* Non-judgmental export (User owns their data).

## 6. Sustainability & Access

We believe that self-knowledge should not be paywalled, but we also believe in sustainable, ad-free software. We balance these goals through a hybrid model:

### 🔓 Always Free: The "Local-First" Core
The complete health and analytics experience is free forever. We do not gate your well-being behind a subscription.
* **Full Feature Set:** Users can track unlimited habits, log unlimited entries, and access 100% of the analytical dashboards and sentiment correlation graphs for free.
* **Local Storage:** By default, data is stored locally on the user's device (SQLite/IndexedDB). This ensures total privacy and zero reliance on internet connectivity.
* **Manual Backups:** Free users can manually export and import their database to transfer between devices.

### ☁️ Paid SaaS: Cloud Sync & Convenience
We offer a paid subscription solely for convenience, not for capability.
* **Encrypted Cloud Sync:** For users who want seamless, automatic synchronization between their Desktop, Mobile, and Web instances.
* **Sustainability:** This fee covers server costs, maintenance, and development, allowing us to keep the core product free and **ad-free** for everyone else.
* **Privacy Preserved:** Even with cloud sync, data is end-to-end encrypted. We cannot see your habits.

## 7. Target Audience

1.  **The Self-Optimizer:** People looking to fine-tune sleep, diet, and productivity.
2.  **The Harm Reducer:** Individuals managing addiction or compulsive behaviors who want to track frequency without the pressure of "cold turkey" quitting.
3.  **The Neurodivergent User:** People with ADHD or Autism who struggle with traditional gamified trackers that demand perfection.
4.  **The Mental Health Advocate:** Users using data to communicate better with therapists or medical professionals.

---

## 8. Success Metrics

* **Retention over Streaks:** We measure success by how long a user keeps *logging*, not by how long they maintain a "perfect" streak.
* **Insight Generation:** Can the user identify a trigger for a bad habit within 30 days of use?
* **Sentiment Shift:** Do users report a stabilization in mood (closer to 3-4 on the scale) regarding their tracked habits over time?
